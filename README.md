Second Exercise (Modules)
=================================================

Please complete the following steps:
 
1. Create a "sentiment" module from the sentiment functionality created in the previous exercise, and use it in your TCP server implementation. Do it by:
 * Creating a directory named "sentiment"
 * Creating a file named "index.js" inside the "sentiment" directory
 * Moving the sentiment functionality to the created "index.js" and exposing it as a module
 * Using the new "sentiment" module from your TCP server implementation
2. Use the require.async module to load the AFINN.json dictionary asynchronously inside your "sentiment" module.

#####Use the AFINN.json in this repository for the score calculations
#####*You can also use the boilerplate index.js as a staring point for your server code*
