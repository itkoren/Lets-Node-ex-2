Second Exercise (Modules)
=================================================

Please complete the following steps:
 
1. Create a "sentiment" module (inside a "sentiment" directory) from the sentiment functionality created in the previous exercise, and use it in your TCP server implementation.
2. Use the require.async module to get the AFINN.json dictionary from "" inside your "sentiment" module.

#####Use the AFINN.json in this repository for the score calculations
#####*You can also use the boilerplate index.js as a staring point for your server code*
